# Beer Advocate User Review Scraper

## Overview
A simple scraper that extracts all Beeradvocate reviews and ratings for a specified username.

## Example
To generate a .csv file called _beerreviews.csv_ of reviews and ratings for Beeradvocate username _joebeer123_:

    scrapy crawl bareviews -a user=joebeer123 -o beerreviews.csv

## Background
This is a small project written to help my brother, who wanted a copy of the 1,400 reviews he's posted on Beeradvocate.com over the past 8 years.

Beeradvocate-reviews is not intended to (nor does it) copy Beeradvocate's entire database. Rather, it retrieves a dataset of reviews associated with a single user.

## Usage
**Requirements:**

Python 3.4+


1. Install dependencies:

        pip install -r requirements.txt
